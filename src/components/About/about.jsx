            In this project, I have focused on the UX part of the project, such
            as preparing for the user evaluation part of the demos and
            presentations - preparing questions, finding participants and
            evaluating answers. I have also worked with the controls for
            locomotions and actions, as well as adding sound effects to the
            scenes and actions.

            In this project, I am with Bosen Cheng. We focused on the environment design of the game.
            More specifically, we designed the Earth, Mars and Moon environment which act as the 
            background of the game arena, which uses free 3D asset from epic store or hand crafted 3D model.
            We utilized the advanced feature of the unreal engine such as volumetric cloud and sky box editor. 
            We also helped fix the control problem in VR mode.

            In this project, I was in charge of the physics-based game design. I designed the game arena with 
            a physics gun and interactive objects for exploration. The games provided method to observe the 
            influence of gravity. I am also in charge of the VR control of the game. I implemented the control 
            so that one can use left controlled to move and right controller to shoot with the gun.

            In this project, I was in charge of the solar system main menu. I designed the solar system which 
            acts as the main menu of the game. It features interactive planets model and sound effect. I am 
            also in charge of the control implementation of the main menu in VR mode, which allow users to 
            use the right controller as to select the planet they want to go.
